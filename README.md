# Gemini Chat API

## Overview

The **Gemini Chat API** allows users to query the content of PDF files stored in a Supabase database. Using vectorization, it finds and returns the most relevant information by comparing content similarities. This project uses multiple helper modules to handle database operations, text extraction, and vectorization.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface to query stored PDF files.
- Supabase integration for storing PDFs and their vectorized representations.
- Efficient text extraction and vectorization for advanced querying.
- Modular structure for easier management and scalability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your system.
- A **Supabase account** with API credentials.
- Environment variables configured in a `.env` file.
